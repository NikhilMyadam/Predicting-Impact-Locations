## Project Description
---
The project is based on Structural Health Monitoring using Artificial Neural Networks. The aim of the project is to locate the impact
## Getting Started
---
### Prerequisites
- A working Anaconda Navigator (e.g. anaconda3) with Python Installation
- Packages such as Jupyter, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, OpenCV, Pillow installed
### Installation
- pip install tensorflow
- pip install opencv
- pip install Pillow
- Download the algorithm in the same directory where the Project Data is saved
### Data
- Use the Project Data to train and validate the model
- It comprises of the Training Data obtained from the Piezoelectric sensors. This data is useful for augmentation
- It also comprises of the Validation Data obtained from the experiments using which we can authenticate the Augmented Data
## Usage
---
- Run the algorithm using the python script 'main.py'. This script imports the necessary interfaces and a functions script useful for carrying out the project task
- The functions script 'my_functions.py' holds all the functions developed during this project for data pre-processing and neural network model development
## Results
The output of the Neural Network predicts the impact locations based on the data used for model development
## Acknowledgements
We thank Dr.-Ing., Bernd Markert for giving us this wonderful opportunity and exposing us to the world of Computational Intelligence. We thank Dr.-Ing., Georg Kocur for giving us this problem statement based on real-life scenarios. The scope and development in the field of Structural Health Monitoring is immense as it gives key information on critical events. We also thank Mr. Denny Thaler for being a constant support and guide during this project.
