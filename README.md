## Project Description
The project is based on Structural Health Monitoring using Artificial Neural Networks. The aim of the project is to locate the impact

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A working Anaconda Navigator (e.g. anaconda3) with Python Installation
- Packages such as Jupyter, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, OpenCV, Pillow installed

### Installation
```
pip install tensorflow
pip install opencv
pip install Pillow
```
- Download the algorithm in the same directory where the Project Data is saved

### Data
- Use the Project Data to train and validate the model
- It comprises of the Training Data obtained from the Piezoelectric sensors. This data is useful for augmentation
- It also comprises of the Validation Data obtained from the experiments using which we can authenticate the Augmented Data

## Usage
- Run the algorithm using the python script 'main.py'. This script imports the necessary interfaces and a functions script useful for carrying out the project task
- The functions script 'my_functions.py' holds all the functions developed during this project for data pre-processing and neural network model development

## Results
The output of the Neural Network predicts the impact locations based on the data used for model development
